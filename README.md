# ChatGPT-Web-App-using-OpenAI-API
I built a clean front-end using HTML and CSS, and connected it to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model using JavaScript. The app takes user input, makes an async API call, handles errors gracefully, and displays a styled response. The UI is minimalistic and responsive, and it demonstrates how to integrate modern AI models into web interfaces easily.
